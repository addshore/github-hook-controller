Github Irc Hook Controller
==================

Makes changing lots of IRC hooks on github easy!

## Install

The first step to use this script is to download composer:

```bash
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Then we have to install our dependencies using:
```bash
$ php composer.phar install
```

## Examples

See /examples
